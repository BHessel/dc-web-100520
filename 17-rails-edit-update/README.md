# Objectives

- Use both form_for and form_tag to generate forms
- Build a form to send get params, and interpret them in the controller
- Use strong params to check for allowed form fields
- Create a new resource using form_for

# Questions

- form_for, how does it work, why do we need an instance variable
- strong_params, require vs permit
- 

# notes
form_tag vs form_for
form_tag:  Always usable
form_for: Used when creating or updating an ActiveRecord object
