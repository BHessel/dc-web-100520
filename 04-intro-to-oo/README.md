## Objectives

* Define `object` in programming domain
* Create a class and instantiate an instance of the class
* Explain the difference between a class and an instance
* Pass arguments to `new` by defining an initialize method in class
* Create instance methods
* Call methods on the implicit or explicit `self`
    - self: inside the class, refers to whatever object called a given method
* Define attribute readers and writers using `attr_` macros
* Explain the need for variable scope and why it's important to not utilize global variables

## Questions
- initialize methods - how do they work?
- email parser lab:  split?
    - def full-name = (something)
- getter / setter methods
    - when would we want only one, or both?
- attr_ macros 
- instance variables vs local variables (@)
    - do we have to initialize (set) them?
